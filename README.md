# Scaled-Conjugate-Gradient-Algorithm


In mathematics, the conjugate gradient method is an algorithm for the numerical solution of particular systems of linear equations, namely those whose matrix is symmetric and positive-definite. The conjugate gradient method is often implemented as an iterative algorithm, applicable to sparse systems that are too large to be handled by a direct implementation or other direct methods such as the Cholesky decomposition. Large sparse systems often arise when numerically solving partial differential equations or optimization problems.

A supervised learning algorithm (Scaled Conjugate Gradient, SCG) with superlinear convergence rate is introduced. The algorithm is based upon a class of optimization techniques well known in numerical analysis as the Conjugate Gradient Methods. SCG uses second order information from the neural network but requires only O(N) memory usage, where N is the number of weights in the network. The performance of SCG is benchmarked against the performance of the standard backpropagation algorithm (BP).
